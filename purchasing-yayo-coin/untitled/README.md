# US

## From BNB \(Binance\)

This is going to be the best option US-based people - low fees, and short overall transaction time. The only requirement is that you're registered on Binance US with ID verification. 

## From BTC \(Gemini and AscendEX\)

If you're not verified on Binance, but you are on Gemini AND AscendEX, the fees through this path will be almost as low as the BNB pathway. There are a few things to keep in mind, though: 

1. AscendEX requires an out-of-country VPN to access
2. AscendEX requires you wait 3 days after registering an account to withdraw any funds
3. Gemini offers free withdrawals, but ONLY 10 per month. If you're used all of yours for this month, the fees will be too high to make this any better than the ETH method. 

## From ETH \(All Others\)

If you're not on any of the above exchanges, this is the path you'll want to look at. The fees will be a bit higher than the above methods and it'll take a little longer, but not as long as registering on another exchange will.
