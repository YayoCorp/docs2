# From OKCoin or AscendEX

### 1. Buy MATIC on OKCoin or AscendEX

MATIC is available on many exchanges, but only [OKCoin](https://www.okcoin.com/buy) and [AscendEX](https://ascendex.com/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/btc/matic\) allow you to withdraw the MATIC on the Matic Mainnet. Using other exchanges will require a bridge. AscendEX has a 24hr hold on withdrawing funds from the time you first register. 

### 2. Send MATIC to your MetaMask

Withdraw the MATIC to your MetaMask wallet address.

### 3. Buy YAYO with MATIC

Visit [QuickSwap.Exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf7058856f405542cd660e8ce4751248F2d037f2B), and click **Connect to a Wallet**.  
  
Go to the settings at the top right, and where it says "Slippage tolerance", enter 6.00%. This is just to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly.
