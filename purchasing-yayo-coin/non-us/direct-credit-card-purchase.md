# Credit Card Purchase

### 1. Buy MATIC directly from RAMP

Go to [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=MATIC). Select your country in the first dropdown menu, and MATIC in the second. Input the amount of money you want to buy with into the "You Pay" section. Fees and transaction details will be displayed. Click "Proceed" after reviewing them.

### 2. Buy YAYO with MATIC

Visit [QuickSwap.Exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf7058856f405542cd660e8ce4751248F2d037f2B), and click **Connect to a Wallet**.  
  
Go to the settings at the top right, and where it says "Slippage tolerance", enter 6.00%. This is just to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly.

If you are unable to process the QuickSwap transaction, you may be out of Matic gas. Go to [matic.supply](https://matic.supply) to receive a faucet.
